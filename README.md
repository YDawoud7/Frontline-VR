# Frontline VR 🚑 🥽
**Frontline VR** is a WebXR-based training simulation designed to bridge the gap between theoretical first-aid knowledge and real-world application. Unlike traditional classroom settings, this project immerses users in high-pressure 3D environments to simulate the urgency and uncertainty of actual crises.

Built using **Wonderland Engine** and **JavaScript**, the application focuses on decision-focused training where users must interact with victims and make time-critical choices. The project currently features two core scenarios:

* **CPR Training**: A cardiac arrest simulation in a café setting, featuring rhythm-based chest compression mechanics and response checks.

* **Emergency Response**: A stabbing incident in an alleyway focusing on hemorrhage control and scene safety.
